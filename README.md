Original members Karen Chavez (the titular “KC”), Rudy Schuet, and Curt Hentschke (collectively, the “Dukes”) recognized each other as kindred spirits and jumped at the opportunity to focus on stretching their skills, playing a wider array of music, and improving their musicianship together as a smaller ensemble. Ryan Pittman began attending the Gilroy Uke Jam after COVID restrictions were lifted and quickly gravitated toward Karen, Curt, and Rudy as other passionate musicians who constantly supported one another, cared about improving, and reveled in making great music together. When Ryan joined the group as their new bass player, KC &amp; the Dukes of Ukes were complete! They’ve been happily making music ever since.
