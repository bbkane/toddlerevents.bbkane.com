In honor of Jazz Appreciation Month, Dave Rocha presents Adventures in Jazz, an entertaining and educational musical program for kids.

Each instrument will be featured on a jazz song, and the program will include “Q and A” between the musicians and kids. Sure to be a valuable and uplifting experience, Adventures will open the door to America’s one true art form.
Dave Rocha has performed with his jazz group for more than 20 years. He has played in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. His band plays an eclectic mix of jazz standards (by Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane, etc.) “pop” tunes (Cole Porter, Gershwin, and Jobim), and original compositions. This covers various styles from up-tempo bebop, “modal” tunes, swing, and blues, to Latin jazz, ballads, and jazz waltz. In addition to his trumpet expertise, Rocha is also an accomplished flugelhorn player. This instrument is similar to the trumpet but has a larger bell, which gives it a darker, more mellow sound.
Registration isn&#39;t required, but you will receive a reminder email the day before.
