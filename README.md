15:00 - 16:00 [Summer Music in the Courtyard-Grateful Brass](https://sccl.bibliocommons.com/events/681801bd9c003a13d2e9aa9b)

Grateful Brass is a dynamic ensemble from the Bay Area&#39;s Jazz Mafia collective that reimagines the music of the Grateful Dead through a vibrant fusion of brass, drums, and vocals—eschewing guitars entirely. Led by trombonist and arranger Adam Theis, a member of Bob Weir’s Wolfpack, the group infuses Dead classics with the spirited rhythms of New Orleans Second Line, the trance-like grooves of Afrobeat, the energetic flair of Balkan brass, and the polyrhythmic complexity of Afro-Cuban music, all anchored by a solid foundation of funk. The group has recently embarked on a fresh creative path with a new project titled “New Directions in Brass”, showcasing original compositions and inventive new arrangements of music by Khruangbin, while continuing to feature select favorites from their Grateful Dead repertoire. This evolution reflects their commitment to pushing the boundaries of brass ensemble music and engaging audiences with bold, genre-defying sounds.Summer Music in the Courtyard
Join us this summer for the Summer Music in the Courtyard series, a weekly all-ages event featuring a vibrant mix of live music every Sunday afternoon. Set in a welcoming outdoor courtyard, each week showcases a different genre—from jazz and folk to classical guitar, and world music—offering something for everyone to enjoy. Bring your friends, family, or just yourself for a relaxing afternoon of great tunes and community spirit under the summer sky.  Don’t forget your hat and sunscreen!

We encourage students to be empowered self-directed learners, to think like scientists and to share their discoveries with others.Registration is required for all youth participants.
