Tell a story to a Furry Friend!
Children are invited to practice reading to gentle, trained assistance dogs who love books! The main objective of this program is to provide a relaxed and “dog-friendly” atmosphere, which allows students to practice the skill of reading. By sitting down next to a dog and reading to the dog, all threats of being judged are put aside: the child relaxes, pats the attentive dog, and focuses on the reading. This program occurs on the 1st Saturday of each month.
Please do not bring your personal dogs, pets, or service animals.
Free. No registration required.
