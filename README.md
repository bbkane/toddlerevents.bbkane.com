Part of Indie Author Fest 2025
All of us have stories. The trick is to figure out how to tell them. Our stories are more than a series of texts or photos on your phone. You can become an in-person storyteller or make videos for your family. You can keep a journal. You can write a narrative around themes such as childhood adventures, loves, career paths, and family.  Coming to a class with deadlines helps you actually put a pen to paper or fingers to a computer keyboard.   
Telling your story shouldn’t be lonely work, and at Indie Author Fest, let’s all participate in a short writing exercise just for fun.   
Liz Dossa is a Certified Guided Autobiography Instructor and has led classes at the Foster City Library, with the Sisters of Mercy and at Mercy Center. Liz worked in Communications with the Sisters of Mercy and has written two books, Notable Excitement, and, with Sister Suzanne Toolan, I Am The Bread of Life. She has enjoyed freelance writing, especially about music and musicians. Leading groups of people writing about their lives continues to be a rich and rewarding experience for her.
