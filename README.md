The exhibit was created through a partnership between Chopsticks Alley Art, the San José Museum of Art, and the San José Office of Economic Development and Cultural Affairs. This exhibition commemorates the remarkable resilience and adaptability of the Vietnamese community in San José. 
Event Highlights: 
Stories from the Edge of the Sea: We are honored to welcome renowned journalist and author Andrew Lam, who will join us to discuss the history of San José&#39;s Vietnamese community 50 years after the end of the Vietnam War. Lam, author of the book &#34;Stories from the Edge of the Sea,&#34; brings a powerful perspective on the last five decades of Vietnamese American experience. 
Poetry and Purpose: Experience a captivating poetry reading and workshop led by Alexandra Huynh.  Alexandra is a Vietnamese American poet from Sacramento, CA. She served as the 2021 National Youth Poet Laureate of the United States, and her work has been featured by NPR, PBS, NBC, and The Washington Post. She recently graduated from Stanford University with a BA in American Studies and a minor in Creative Writing. 
Creative Expressions: Unleash your inner artist! We invite community members to create a painting on a small canvas to be displayed by the California Room. Art supplies will be provided, so come ready to paint and leave your mark on this living legacy.
This is a unique opportunity to honor the past, engage with powerful stories, and contribute to the vibrant living history of San José&#39;s Vietnamese community. We look forward to celebrating with you.
