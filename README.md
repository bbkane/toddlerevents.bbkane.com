The sweet illustrations in Yoga Adventure! guide children into more than a dozen yoga poses, some mimicking a distinctive animal from each global region, others paired with modes of transportation to connect them all.

Our goal is to give young children a developmentally appropriate way to explore yoga poses, mindfulness, and social emotional learning.
