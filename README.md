Múa hát song ngữ bằng tiếng Anh và tiếng Việt được thiết kế để phù hợp với nhiều lứa tuổi. Chúng tôi mong muốn mời cả gia đình cùng tham gia vào các hoạt động này để cùng hát các bài đồng dao, cùng vận động ngón tay và cùng nhảy múa vui vẻ. Âm nhạc và nhảy múa là một trải nghiệm thú vị và giúp cho cả gia đình tương tác tốt hơn, thúc đẩy niềm vui học tập cho trẻ em ở mọi lứa tuổi. Mọi người đều được nhiệt liệt chào đón tại chương trình này. 
Kể chuyện song ngữ và múa hát cùng với làm thủ công vào thứ ba của tuần thứ tư trong tháng. Chương trình hoàn toàn miễn phí và không cần phải đăng ký trước.
