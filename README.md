In honor of Jazz Appreciation Month, Dave Rocha presents Adventures in Jazz, an entertaining and educational musical program for kids. Performed by talented and experienced jazz musicians, the show opens the doors of jazz music to young minds. This educational jazz program is for preschool, elementary, and middle school kids. The program will include talking about and demonstrating jazz improvisation, explaining and demonstrating what role each of the instruments plays in the jazz band, what family they are in, what they are made of, and how each instrument is played. Each instrument will be featured on a jazz song, and the program will include “Q and A” between the musicians and kids. Sure to be a valuable and uplifting experience, Adventures will open the door to America’s one true art form.
Dave Rocha has performed with his jazz group for more than 20 years. He has played in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. His band plays an eclectic mix of jazz standards (by Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane, etc.) “pop” tunes (Cole Porter, Gershwin, and Jobim), and original compositions. This covers various styles from up-tempo bebop, “modal” tunes, swing, and blues, to Latin jazz, ballads, and jazz waltz. In addition to his trumpet expertise, Rocha is also an accomplished flugelhorn player. This instrument is similar to the trumpet but has a larger bell, which gives it a darker, more mellow sound.

Tell a story to a Furry Friend!
Children are invited to practice reading to gentle, trained assistance dogs who love books! The main objective of this program is to provide a relaxed and “dog-friendly” atmosphere, which allows students to practice the skill of reading. By sitting down next to a dog and reading to the dog, all threats of being judged are put aside: the child relaxes, pats the attentive dog, and focuses on the reading. This program occurs on the 1st Saturday of each month.
Please do not bring your own personal dogs, pets, or service animals.
Free. No registration required.
