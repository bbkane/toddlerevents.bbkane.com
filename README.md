The sweet illustrations in Yoga Adventure! guide children into more than a dozen yoga poses, some mimicking a distinctive animal from each global region, others paired with modes of transportation to connect them all. Written by a children’s yoga expert and JAMaROO Kids Founder Jamaica Stevens, the playful story concludes with step-by-step instructions for each yoga pose and a world map with a fun fact about each animal.On our journey, we will sing yoga songs and practice breathing techniques. Our goal is to give young children a developmentally appropriate way to explore yoga poses, mindfulness, and social emotional learning.
